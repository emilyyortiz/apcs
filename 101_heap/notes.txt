HW101: Heap o'Trouble
2022-05-16 mon
time spent: 0.5 hrs

DISCO
- minheaps have the smallest value at the top

QCC
- Could the right and left branches be for even and odd values?
- Does a heap support duplicate values?
- Do you place the values to optimize for binary search?
  - Ex: If you have 1-7 with 1 at the top, do (2 3 4) go on the left and (5 6 7) go on the right?
