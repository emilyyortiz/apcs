DISCO:
  - When trying to compile the code we got this error:
  ```
      Note: BinSearch.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
      Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
  ```
  The reason for this error is that Comparable can store many different objects and it is a warning that java may have run time errors when trying to compare two Comparables as they may be different object types
  The code can still run and the error can be ignored if you know that the objects in Comparable are of the same type
QCC:
  - though Lauren used binary operands that aren't allowed for objects, it still ran despite an error. it only runs in some instances though
