DISCO
* We are using merge sort.

QCC
* Does the deck of cards have to be divided exactly evenly in the very beginning?
* How should you divide cards if you don't have an even number?
* Is it possible to sort a deck of 52 cards with 30 something students?
* This doesn't really make sense to me: let's say you have two cards, why would you give those to two people only to have them returned to you. Couldn't you just sort your two cards then? I guess this is more efficient/ makes more sense for a computer, but I am struggling to wrap my head around sorting a deck of cards like this.

THINKER FIRMWARE
* If you have more than one card, divide your cards evenly between two other people.
* Once you have one card, return it to who gave it to you.
* When cards are returned to you, sort them and return them to the next person.
